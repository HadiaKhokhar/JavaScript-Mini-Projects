            <h1>When Your Code Isn't Working: What to Do Next?</h1>
            <p>
                We've all been there—staring at the screen, completely frustrated because the code just <span>won't work</span>.
                Whether
                it's an unexpected bug, a missing semicolon, or just a logic error you can't pinpoint, coding struggles
                are part
                of every developer's journey.
            </p>

            <p>
                The image above perfectly captures the feeling of helplessness—hands on your head, questioning your
                career
                choices, and contemplating the mysteries of JavaScript scope. But frustration doesn't have to be the
                end—let's
                turn it into a productive debugging process.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Take a Step Back 🧘‍♂️</h2>
            <p>
                When frustration kicks in, <span>pause for a moment</span>. Step away from the screen, take a deep breath, and
                <span>reset your mind</span>. A short break can help you return with a fresh perspective.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Read the Error Message Carefully 🔍</h2>
            <p>
                Error messages are your best friend. Instead of panicking, break down what it's telling you. Is it a
                <span>syntax
                error</span>? A <span>Logic issue</span> ? A <span>missing dependency</span>? Google is your ally—search the exact error
                message!
            </p>

            <h2>3. Console.log Everything 🖥️</h2>
            <p>
                If something isn't behaving as expected, print out values using `console.log()`. Seeing what's happening
                <span>step
                by step</span> can help you pinpoint where things go wrong.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Rubber Duck Debugging 🦆</h2>
            <p>
                Try explaining the problem <span>out loud</span>, even to an inanimate object (like a rubber duck). Verbalizing
                your
                logic often helps you <span>catch your own mistakes</span>.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Check for Typos & Syntax Errors ✍️</h2>
            <p>
                A missing `;`, an extra `{}`, or an incorrect variable name—sometimes it's <span>the smallest mistake</span> that
                breaks
                everything. A fresh look at your syntax can save hours of debugging.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Use Debugging Tools 🛠️</h2>
            <p>
                Modern browsers have <span>Developer Tools</span> (`F12` in Chrome) that let you inspect elements, track errors,
                and set
                breakpoints in JavaScript. Use them!
            </p>

            <h2>7. Ask for Help (But First, Do Your Research) 🤝</h2>
            <p>
                If you're stuck, <span>don't suffer in silence</span>. Ask a fellow developer, post on Stack Overflow, or check
                documentation. Just make sure you <span>explain what you've tried</span> —this shows effort and increases your
                chances of
                getting a useful answer.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Don't Be Afraid to Restart 🔄</h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes, the best fix is a <span>fresh start</span>. Restart your IDE, refresh your browser, or even <span>rewrite
                the
                section of code</span> from scratch. You'll be surprised how often this works!
            </p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts 💡</h2>
            <p>
                Coding isn't just about getting things right on the first try—it's about <span>problem-solving, debugging,
                and
                persistence</span>. Every error you encounter is an opportunity to <span>learn and grow as a developer</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                So the next time your code doesn't work, instead of frustration, <span>embrace the challenge</span>—because
                that's how
                real developers <span>become great developers</span>. 🚀
            </p>
